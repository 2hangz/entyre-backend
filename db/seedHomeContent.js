    content: `# Transforming End-of-Life Tyres into Valuable Resources

Welcome to the ENTYRE project platform - your comprehensive resource for exploring innovative End-of-Life Tyre (ELT) valorisation pathways in Ireland.

## About the Project

The ENTYRE project focuses on developing sustainable solutions for the approximately 55,000 tonnes of waste tyres generated annually in Ireland. Through cutting-edge research and innovative technologies, we're transforming waste into valuable resources while supporting Ireland's circular economy goals.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Advanced recycling technologies
- Economic viability assessment  
- Environmental impact analysis
- Policy and regulatory frameworks
- Industry collaboration and implementation

Explore our interactive tools, research findings, and comprehensive pathway analysis to discover how End-of-Life Tyres can become a valuable resource rather than waste.`
